1|1|2007 LVAC Cake Race|Phoenix Park|2007-12-22 00:00:00|<p><strong>Ray Boyle</strong>&nbsp;held off the challenge of last year&rsquo;s winner,&nbsp;<strong>Martin Dorgan</strong>, to take the 2007 Cake Race Title. The 5K race was held again on grass this year, with underfoot conditions soft but perfect for cross country racing. The sun shone down on the 35 Liffey Valley Athletes who togged off in the Club Colours for the event. With this being a handicap race, all athletes were in with a chance of winning the Big Prize...compliments of a Liffey Valley Ladies pre Christmas party!</p> <p>Ray Boyle, one of the stalwarts of the Senior Mens team has been a member of Liffey Valley for just over year. He has had some good runs so far this cross country season in particular at the Leinster Intermediate in Abbelyeix, where he helped Liffey Valley to the bronze medals. Having recovered well from the National Novice in Dungarvan last weekend, he was able to knock over 2 minutes off his time from the Cake Race last year! We are delighted to see Ray take his first Liffey Valley title, the first of many no doubt.</p> <p>Martin Dorgan was obviously fond of the Cake last year. He ran with fierce determination and also recorded a faster time from last year despite only recently recovering from a bout of the flu. However, he had to settle for 2nd on this occasion&hellip;I&rsquo;m sure Ray will give him a slice if he asks nicely! Well done Martin. Martin was followed home by Pierce Geoghegan who also had his eyes set on taking the cake back to Kerry for the Christmas. However it was not to be on this occasion. He crossed the line &amp; clocked a magnificent time of 16.49, so all eyes will be on him in the Club Cross Country Championship on 6th Jan, where he will surely be a strong contender for the medals.</p> <p>In all, 35 athletes competed today, breaking the record of 32 who competed last year. Some fine runs from the 9 ladies who competed, in particular Aoife, who finished in a fantastic 5th &ndash; a good start for her in the Winter League!<strong>Mairead Murphy</strong>&nbsp;was fastest of the Ladies in a time of 20.37 &amp; Tom O&rsquo;Connor was fastest of the Men clocking 16.39. Great to see&nbsp;<strong>Mairead Creedon</strong>&nbsp;making a return from injury to compete today &amp; also to&nbsp;<strong>Melissa Sheridan</strong>, the latest addition to the Ladies Section &ndash; well done on such a good race.</p> <p>After the race proceedings once again moved back to the Club House where the very important presentation took place. Mairead organised the tea &amp; biscuits for everyone, which was much appreciated on such a cold December morning! Ray was presented with the Cake by Club Chairman&nbsp;<strong>Malcolm Edger</strong>. All those involved whether racing or assisting were presented with a prize &amp; once again a wonderful Liffey Valley morning was had by all.</p> <p>Once again, a big thanks must go to Jim &amp; Nick for organising the handicaps &amp; to stewards,&nbsp;<strong>Malcolm, Tom, George, Hilary, Mark &amp; Majella&nbsp;</strong>thank you also, it is much appreciated.</p> <p>Jim &amp; Nick then reminded us about the Club Multi Terrain Race next Saturday &amp; all members are asked to assist at the Tom Brennan Memorial race on New Years Day if they are not competing on the teams.</p> <p>On behalf of all the committee, Malcolm wished all a very Happy Christmas&hellip;</p> <p><strong>Liz</strong></p>|lvaccake2007.html||2010-05-13 00:53:02.763000000|1

30|1|2009 Dublin Masters Cross Country|Phoenix Park|2009-01-04 00:00:00|<p>The Dublin Masters took place last Sunday 4th around the grounds next to the Ordnance Survey complex. This year, the course was changed to include a new uphill/downhill section as well as a pass over a stream which tested everyone&rsquo;s ability.</p> <p>The Ladies were first off, running two full laps to complete 4km. Mairead Murphy had an extraordinary race, managing to finish in 3rd place overall and claiming gold in W40 category. She made the decisive move in the downhill section when she overtook Raheny lady, Denise Ryan, just before crossing the stream and secure the W40 title. What a week for her! After winning the W40 category on New Year&rsquo;s Day in our Tom Brennan Memorial, three days later, she won the Dublin title in her category!</p> <p>Christine Roche with a strong performance was next in 17th place and Una Reilly completed the team finishing in 22nd place. She also claimed 2nd in the W55 category as she did last year. The Ladies Masters team finished in 4th place (42 points), missing out on a podium spot by just 3 points.</p> <p>Next were the men, with three and a half laps to complete 7.1 km. Right from the start, Lea Fulcher and Tom O&rsquo;Connor were well situated in the first spots of the race.<br /> As the race went through, Tom picked up some places and finished in a great 3rd place overall and retained his M45 title.</p> <p>Lea was next in 5th place overall and claim silver in M35, his first ever Master medal.<br /> Paul Balfe completed a strong run to finish in 10th place overall (5th M35), followed by Gerry Daly in 15th place (4th M40) who completed the Liffey Valley Masters team.<br /> Paul Power had a great performance during the three laps and finished in 29th place overall.</p> <p>Pat Collins finished in 45th place wining the M60 category as the previous year. Quite a remarkable achievement taking into account that he had to stop as he lost his spike on the stream pass.</p> <p>The Men&rsquo;s Masters Team won the title with a total of 34 points, 17 points clear from the second team Tallaght AC.</p> <p>Fantastic performance&rsquo;s from all the Masters who won 6 medals (4 gold and 2 silvers).</p> <p>Well done to all who supported around the course. Again a good number of clubmates were around.</p> <p>Next stage for the Masters will be in Santry in February 15th where the National will take place.</p> <p>Best of luck!</p> <p>Javier.</p>|DublinMasters2009.pdf||2010-05-13 00:36:21.853000000|1

48|1|LVAC 5km & 10km Road Races for the George Harrison & Myles Cullen Trophies|Phoenix Park|2009-06-21 00:00:00|<p>Sunday 21st June 2009 became a date to remember for all Liffey Valley members as the inaugral running of the&nbsp;<strong>Myles Cullen</strong>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<strong>George Harrison</strong>&nbsp;Memorial races took place in the Phoenix Park.</p> <p>When&nbsp;<strong>Myles Cullen</strong>, one of the founding Members of LVAC, passed away in November 2006, all those who remembered him spoke fondly of him and recited many tales of his creative fundraising, enthusiasm and how we had him to thank for our club house in Islandbridge today.</p> <p>In June 2008&nbsp;<strong>George Harrison</strong>, one of those responsible for rejuvenating the Ladies section 5 years ago, passed away suddenly after a run in the park.</p> <p>Shortly after,&nbsp;<strong>Steve Coughlan</strong>&nbsp;suggested that we organise a Memorial race for both&nbsp;<strong>Myles &amp; George</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Myles</strong>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<strong>George</strong>&nbsp;were long standing members who had demonstrated great commitment and dedication to Liffey Valley AC.</p> <p>In turn, the club wanted to mark&nbsp;<strong>George</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Myles</strong>&nbsp;contribution with annual races held in their memory and trophies that would become as important as the Avondale Cup. And so,&nbsp;<strong>Majella Twomey</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Tom McCormack</strong>sourced two antique silver cups to present to the winners of the Women's 5k race as the&nbsp;<strong>George Harrison Trophy</strong>&nbsp;and of the Men's 10k race as the&nbsp;<strong>Myles Cullen Trophy</strong>.</p> <p>Both races took place around the 2.5k lap of the Magazine Fort. In damp and drizzly conditions the race kicked off with 40 athletes participating, including&nbsp;<strong>Derek Cullen</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Conor Cullen</strong>, son's of Myles.</p> <p>As the race was a sealed handicap the fastest athletes on the day,&nbsp;<strong>Tom O'Connor</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Mairead Murph</strong>y, were unlikely to take the awards on this occasion. The athletes would have to wait until the presentation ceremony to see who would be the first to have their names engraved on the beautiful new trophies.</p> <p>After the race, proceedings moved up the road to the Gael Scoil, where&nbsp;<strong>Barbara</strong>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<strong>Michelle</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Coughlan</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Marie Riney</strong>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<strong>Siobhan Reilly</strong>&nbsp;were hard at work setting out the tea &amp; sandwiches.</p> <p>The presentation ceremony commenced with&nbsp;<strong>Malcolm Edger</strong>&nbsp;welcoming the families and athletes to the Gael Scoil.&nbsp;<strong>Nick Davis</strong>&nbsp;spoke of his memories of both&nbsp;<strong>Myles</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>George,</strong>&nbsp;highlighting the many contributions they each made to the club in various ways.</p> <p><strong>Malcolm</strong>&nbsp;then called upon&nbsp;<strong>Mrs Ann Harrison</strong>&nbsp;to present the&nbsp;<strong>George Harrison Trophy</strong>&nbsp;to the winner of the Ladies 5K race. It was with great cheer &amp; delight that the cup was presented to&nbsp;<strong>Majella Twomey</strong>, who we know will relish having the cup on the mantelpiece. It was fitting that&nbsp;<strong>Majella</strong>&nbsp;became the inaugral winner of this race, as she was one of the earlier women athletes 'coaxed' around the 2 mile lap by&nbsp;<strong>George</strong>&nbsp;in the very early days of the resurrection of the ladies section.</p> <p>Next&nbsp;<strong>Malcolm</strong>&nbsp;called upon&nbsp;<strong>Mrs Irene Cullen</strong>&nbsp;to present the&nbsp;<strong>Myles Cullen Trophy</strong>&nbsp;for the Men&rsquo;s 10K race. In this instance the Trophy was awarded to veteran Liffey Valley legend,&nbsp;<strong>John Cullen</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>John</strong>, a very dedicated and successful athlete admitted that of all the medals he has won over the years, he is hugely honoured that his name will be the first engraved on this trophy in memory&nbsp;<strong>Myles</strong>, a very special person whom he had the pleasure of knowing.</p> <p>Overall, the day was a huge success, mainly due to the enthusiasm of both the&nbsp;<strong>Cullen</strong>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<strong>Harrison</strong>&nbsp;families and we would like to thank them sincerely for making the effort to come along. We do hope to see everyone again next year!</p> <p>To all those who no doubt rose at dawn to prepare sandwiches, organise cakes, biscuits, tea &amp; coffee, again, a huge thanks is due to you all for your help. Without&nbsp;<strong>Ciaran Reilly</strong>&nbsp;providing the hall, the presentation would not have been possible. Not only was Ciaran organising the hall, he also finished 2nd overall in the race itself, which was a fantastic result considering he had claimed 3rd prize in the Dublin Championships 1,500m the night before!

An inspiration to us all!</p> <p>The success of the day was down to real team effort with everybody contributing in some fashion either by helping out, participating or supporting. It was unanimously agreed that the real winner on the day was Liffey Valley AC, a club with great camaraderie and team spirit in this the celebration of its members past &amp; present.<br /> <br /> Well done to all and congratulations to&nbsp;<strong>Majella</strong>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<strong>John</strong>&nbsp;on their fantastic achievements.</p> <p c=""><strong>Liz</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><em><strong><a href="http://www.liffeyvalleyac.com/archive/gallery/2009/lvacroadraces2009.pdf">Race Photos</a></strong></em></p>|LVACSummerRoadRaces2009.pdf||2010-12-30 16:10:10.950000000|1

85|1|LVAC €1m Mile Track Challenge|ALSAA|2008-07-24 00:00:00|<p>Summer had finally arrived to mark the end of the track season at ALSAA for another year. In contrast to our last club races, the rain coats were left at home &amp; out came the sun!</p> <p>A one mile open handicap race was held &amp; 21 athletes arrived to participate. For some, having raced in the Graded mile in Irishtown the night before it was going to be a test of endurance. However at 7.45 the race kicked off with Jimmy Monaghan &amp; Martin Wright leading the field. As athletes made their way around the 4 laps the gaps started to disappear &amp; true to form the handicappers got it right again &ndash; when all 21 athletes approached the finish within 100m of the finish. It was a tough race to the line for Pierce Geogheghan who battled hard to see off the challenge of Mairead Murphy who was encouraged around the race by husband Eric &amp; her two children. However, the one mile race in the graded in Irishtown the previous night did not inhibit Pierce as he stormed home to take victory in an actual time of 4.49. Mairead finished in a very impressive time of 5.32. Third home was Veteran Star, the man himself, John Cullen in a time of 5.08.</p> <p>Ciaran Reilly proved the fasted man on the night to finish in a time of 4.38. Ciaran had set a new PB over the mile the previous night, finishing in a time of 4.33 on that occasion. Well done to Ciaran - fairly impressive running despite the long night of celebrations at Aoife&rsquo;s wedding the previous Friday night&hellip;!</p> <p>The race was sponsored by our very own Tom McCormack, who presented prizes to the top finishers &amp; also a spot prize to Paul Balfe who finished in 10th. Thanks to Tom for this.</p> <p>We were joined on the night by two athletes from Malta, Mario &amp; Charmaine Pisani who are here in Ireland on holidays. They are members of Athletica Pembroke in Malta. Having joined us for training on Tuesday night, Mario competed in the race &amp; finished in a time of 4.46. Luckily Charmaine had recorded the race, as we nearly had to go to the video evidence due to some technical difficulties at the finish line! However, all worked out on the night due to the many hands on board to help out.</p> <p>Young Fintan Dorgan made his first appearance at a Liffey Valley race, but unfortunately on this occasion he was unable to witness his Daddy racing. We wish Martin a speedy recovery from his calf injury&hellip;</p> <p class="main">The night was a huge success &amp; again it is thanks to Nick &amp; Jim for organising this &amp; getting the times so accurate once again. Thanks to all those who helped on the night, Tom, Kathryn, Javier, Martin, Eithne &amp; Liz. We retired to the bar for some well deserved refreshments afterwards where we wished Kathryn Davis best wishes for her trip to Beijing where she is reporting on the Olympics.</p> <p>Liz</p>|lvac1mile2008.html||2010-09-18 23:20:09.397000000|1

100|1|LVAC Avondale Cup|Phoenix Park|2010-03-30 00:00:00|<p><strong>Paul Balfe </strong>is the winner of the 52nd Avondale Cup, held on a winter's around the Magazine Fort - Acres Bicycle Track. On the occasion of the 52nd Avondale Cup Race and the first training evening of summer time, we were unfortunately greeted with&nbsp;wind, sleet &amp; snow! It seems difficult to believe that 3 weeks ago we gathered on the same course for the AAI National Cross Country&nbsp;in glorious sunshine.</p> <p>However, this did not deter the 35 brave Liffey Valley athletes to take to the start line of this annual 4-mile race. Normally held on the&nbsp;Furze Road - Ordnance Survey - Chesterfield Avenue lap, this year it was moved to the bicycle track at the Magazine Fort with athletes&nbsp;having to compete just over two laps.</p> <p>Hilary Blyth commenced this handicap race in fine style &amp; held the lead for much of the first lap. However Jimmy Monaghan chased her&nbsp;down with much determination, with his tough winter training paying off with a fine performance from him. Eddie McGrath was last off&nbsp;the mark &amp; quickly set about chasing down the rest of the pack.</p> <p>All athletes ran well despite the conditions &amp; it was good to see so many new faces out racing in the LVAC colours. The race stewards&nbsp;congregated at the Magazine Fort for the finish and it seemed a battle was going on over the last 400m between the top 10 athletes.&nbsp;With light failing it was difficult to determine who was winning that battle, but it emerged that Paul Balfe was in the lead. Paul held on to&nbsp;take the victory and will now have his name engraved on this prestigious trophy.</p> <p>Diarmaid O'Sullivan and John Cullen completed the podium places in 2nd &amp; 3rd in times of 21.41 &amp; 22.29 respectively. Mairead Murphy&nbsp;was fastest of the Ladies and finished in a time of 24.38. Overall, it was a great night for Liffey Valley AC with many personal best times&nbsp;set, which is a testament to all the hard winter training.</p> <p>After the race Nick Davis spoke about our Club Chairman, Malcolm Edger, and informed all that Malcolm is moving to South Africa for&nbsp;the coming year. Unfortunately Malcolm was unable to attend tonight due to a busy schedule in advance of his departure. However, a&nbsp;round of applause was given in his absence in acknowledgement and thanks for all his hard work over his 12 years as Club Chairman.&nbsp;We wish him all the best in his new adventure.</p> <p>Again, thanks to Nick &amp; Jim for compiling the handicaps and to Kathryn Davis, Tom McCormack and Dermot Ryan for assisting at the&nbsp;race. Well done to all who took part.</p> <p>Liz</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>|AvondaleCup2010.pdf||2010-12-30 16:15:30.050000000|1

Mark Kenneally won his first senior title after seven previous silvers on country and track.</p> <p>For Liffey Valley, it was Eddie McGrath who was first man home as he ran a fine race while working his way back to full fitness.

18|1|2008 Leinster Intermediate Cross Country|Ballinakill, Co. Laois|2008-11-09 00:00:00|<p>If anyone remembers the National Intermediate XC in Santry in Feb 2007, they would have some idea of what conditions were like in Heywood college on sunday last. A mud fest more akin to a wet &lsquo;Oxegen&rsquo; festival than to good racing conditions is what we observed. However Liffey Valley athletes braved the cold, wet &amp; muck &amp; stripped off to compete in both the Ladies &amp; men&rsquo;s competitions.</p> <p>The girls were the first to the start line after a good warm up around this arduous course. It was straight into a hill from the gun &amp; all girls did well to remain up front. Lena demonstrated her racing potential after her 10th place finish in Dublin Intermediate &amp; went on to finish in 18th overall in Leinster. The 4000m course comprised of some tough hills, a few ditches &amp; plenty of other challenges like lost spikes &amp; runners buried in the muck! However, Christine, Marj &amp; Sinead Sinnott, in her first race with Liffey Valley, all battled hard throughout &amp; finished in 5th position overall. It was a commendable team effort &amp; in ways a baptism of fire for Sinead in her debut cross country race, however, on the bright side&hellip;conditions cant get much worst than that!!</p> <p>The men&rsquo;s team of Paul, Ciaran, Gavin, Ritchie, Brendan, Cian, Liban, John then faced into their 10,000 m race, in even &lsquo;softer&rsquo; conditions after the ladies race &amp; of course after all of the juveniles racing part of the course beforehand. For the first lap Ciaran went with the leading pack &amp; was then accompanied by Paul as the race progressed. Both finished 9th &amp; 10th after a tremendous run &amp; led home the LVAC team. Next home was Richard Oakley followed closely by newcomer Gavin Lloyd after completing not one but two marathons in the last month, including the Dublin marathon with Sinead only 2 weeks previously. Richard &amp; Gavin finished in 46th &amp; 47th positions respectively. Next home was Brendan Beere who ran well despite him only recently returning from injury &amp; this also being his first XC race. Cian, Liban &amp; John Parker concluded the Liffey Valley team &amp; it was great to see the lads battling it out &amp; tackling the tough conditions so bravely. The Men repeated the feat of the ladies &amp; also finished in 5th position.</p> <p>Well done to all who raced &amp; kept the Club colours flying high. Thanks also to Nick, Kathryn, Jimmy &amp; Javier who braved the cold to support their club mates. Coach Jim was away in Brussels on International duty &amp; accordingly was unable to attend.</p> <p><br /> Next race is the Club 4 mile Cross Country at 11.30 on 22nd November.</p> <p>Liz</p>|leinsterinterxc2008.pdf||2010-05-13 00:42:17.087000000|1
19|1|2008 Dublin Novice Cross Country |Phoenix Park|2008-09-28 00:00:00|<p>The Dublin Novice took place in the Phoenix Park on 28th September last, once again in glorious weather conditions, similar to last year. Although it was once again held at the Magazine Fort, the course was slightly different from last year&rsquo;s race.</p> <p>The ladies were first to the start line to test the new 3000m course. Lena Sinclair in her debut performance for Liffey Valley, led the team home in 15th Position followed closely by Christine Roche, both having worked together throughout the race. Marj Twomey showed her usual fighting spirit in yet another spectacular sprint for the line, with Mairead Creedon finishing just behind, completing the team scoring with our Ladies finishing 6th, not too far away from the top four. It was commendable in itself to have a Ladies team competing on this particular occasion due to a social event the previous night which clashed with the race due to the late date change for the Novice. The girls should be given much credit for showing such commitment &amp; dedication in making the effort to line out for the club under the circumstances.Well done to you all girls!</p> <p>The Men&rsquo;s race set off at a blistering pace around the 6km course. Lea Fulcher, Pierce Geoghegan &amp; Ciaran Reilly were at the fore from early on, with Lea holding onto the leading group once the break opened up. Lea had a great race, eventually taking 4th place overall with Pierce in 6th &amp; Ciaran in 7th, all massive improvements on last year. Andy Nason raced hard to maintain 4th spot on the Liffey Valley team &amp; was followed by Mick Dunne who also showed a great improvement on 2007. There were a few debut performances on the men&rsquo;s team also with John Parker following in the footsteps of his father, who was a member of Liffey Valley many years ago. John showed great potential in his first competitive race for the club. The team was also assisted by the efforts of Liban Mohamed &amp; Cian Cullinane who no doubt will be names to watch in the future.</p> <p>Never was it more evident that &lsquo;every place counts&rsquo; as it was on this occasion. We retired to the Donore club house to learn the team results from each race. It was a bittersweet result for the boys, achieving magnificent silver medals, however rather unlucky not to achieve the gold.</p> <p>They tied with DSD on 42 points at the top, but on count back were awarded the silver, equalling their performance from 2007. The boys came agonisingly close to breaking novice this year but hopefully it will be 3rd time lucky for 2009! Well done to all involved.</p> <p>Liz</p>|DublinNoviceXC2008.pdf||2010-05-13 00:46:12.510000000|1

28|1|LVAC Multi Terrain Race|Phoenix Park|2008-12-27 00:00:00|<p>It was a beautiful crisp, sunny winter's day as 30 members gathered for the 12th LVAC Annual Multi Terrain Race.&nbsp; <br /> Tom, Malcolm and Kathryn started the race, with Nick the first athlete to go. The course conditions were better than normal, with just the steep path at the bottom of the Kyber Pass road the most difficult part of the course to negotiate, twice!</p> <p>Christmas celebrations would have to be paid for..&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> Coming around the top of the woods for the second time, Joe was well ahead of the chasing duo of the two Jims. <br /> Dermot, Siobhan, Martin &amp; Fintan were there to capture times and pictures as Joe moved into the top 3 of the LVAC 2008/9 Winter League.</p>|MultiTerrain2008.pdf||2010-12-30 16:04:10.280000000|1

54|1|2007 Dublin Intermediate Cross Country|Tymon Park|2007-10-14 00:00:00|<p>History was made in Tymon Park on Sunday 14th October last, when both the Ladies &amp; Mens Intermediate Teams claimed silver medals in the team races.</p> <p>In glorious weather conditions, similar to that of the Novice a week ago, the ladies race commenced at 1pm around the 4000m course in Tymon Park.</p> <p>The field of 42 athletes was led out from the gun by Siobhan Donachie. Michelle Geoghegan quickly settled into the race to join the leading pack. Over the course of the race the girls ran with determination &amp; fought hard to gain each position around the course. The long journey up from Waterford on Sunday morning didn&rsquo;t seem to have any detrimental effects on Claire Fowler, who in her first race for Liffey Valley, and indeed her first ever cross country race, finished in a very impressive 16th position. She was overtaken in the finishing straight by Siobhan who ran a very tactical race to pick off quite a number of places over the second lap finishing in an excellent time of 19.27.&nbsp;<br /> Once again, the first lady home for Liffey Valley was Michelle Geoghegan who crossed the line in 13th position in a time of 19.13. Lindsay Doulton had another fine run to finish just behind Claire in 17th place. Marj Twomey battled all the way to the line in a sprint finish to beat the Raheney girl who had passed her just 300m earlier, crossing the line in 21st place. Aoife Reilly concluded the Liffey Valley Ladies team on this historic day when only a year ago, at this same event, Liffey Valley fielded their first ever Ladies Intermediate team. It highlights the progress that has been made within the Ladies section of the club &amp; full praise must be given to Coach Nick Davis &amp; indeed to all the girls who each made such a huge effort on the day to participate.</p> <p>The men&rsquo;s race was equally as exciting for the club as the earlier ladies race. The Men had a hard act to follow after the outstanding performances from all the ladies. Lea Fulcher, in only his 3rd race in the Liffey Valley singlet, attacked the race from the gun and held onto the leading pack of 6 athletes. Together with Ciaran Reilly, the team battled hard over the 10,000m race. Viktor &amp; Javier held Ciaran &amp; Lea in their sights &amp; with great cheering from supporters lined around the course, they continued to move up the field. Lea Fulcher, who was 7th in the Novice last weekend, improved on his performance again this week &amp; was first Liffey Valley man home in 5th position in a time of 37.27. Ciaran Reilly also improved on his 9th place position in the Novice had another very impressive run to finish in 8th position. It was almost a sea of yellow singlets approaching the finish; with Viktor Vasse racing home in 10th place &amp; Javier close behind in 15th. Pierce Geoghegan had a great run to finish in 22nd place in a time of 41.02. Pierce, not long back after injury &amp; exams should be very pleased with this performance. Mick Dunne &amp; Ray Boyle ran a very strong race also to complete Liffey Valley team in 23rd &amp; 27th place respectively.</p> <p>Liffey Valley Men equalled the fine performance of the ladies &amp; took the silver team prize and with Lea, Ciaran &amp; Viktor finishing in the top ten, they will have the opportunity to race in the navy &amp; blue of Dublin in the forthcoming Leinster Intermediate on November 11th&hellip;not bad for the English man, the Dub &amp; the Hungarian!!</p> <p>It was great to see such support around the course for the athletes &amp; we would hope to see similar number of supporters in the forthcoming races. The level of support for Liffey Valley was magnified when we retired to the bar to collect the fine haul of silver medals. It was with great cheering &amp; applause that the Ladies - Michelle, Siobhan, Claire, Lindsay &amp; the Men - Lea, Ciaran, Viktor &amp; Javier were presented with their medals with the hope of may more to follow in the future.</p> <p>Liz</p> <p><b><a href="http://www.liffeyvalleyac.com/archive/gallery/2007/DublinIntermediateXC2007.pdf">Click here for photos</a></b></p>|dublininterxc2007.html||2010-05-13 00:51:24.773000000|1
61|1|Jingle Bells 5km Road Race|Phoenix Park|2007-12-02 00:00:00|<p>In blustery conditions similar to last year, 28 Liffey Valley athletes took part in the Annual Jingle Bells 5K in the Phoenix Park Sunday last.</p> <p>Unfortunately no team prizes this year, but some very good individual runs in particular from&nbsp;<strong>Pierce Geoghegan</strong>, who was first Liffey Valley man home in a time of 16.17.&nbsp;<strong>Ciaran Reilly</strong>&nbsp;also had a great run to finish in a time of 16.19. However, it was his father&nbsp;<strong>Paddy Reilly</strong>&nbsp;who stole the show on this occasion by winning the 055 category and came away with the prize &amp; a Christmas cake!&nbsp;<strong>Pat Collins</strong>&nbsp;kept the flag flying for the LVAC Masters and won the 060 event &ndash; another fine run from Pat, finishing in a magnificent time of 19.25.</p> <p>Eight LVAC Ladies competed, with&nbsp;<strong>Siobhan</strong>&nbsp;coming 2nd in the W35 category in a time of 21.31, followed closely by Christine in a time of 21.48. All ladies ran well and were supported by the Men&rsquo;s team on the finishing straight.</p> <p>Thanks to all who came out to support &amp; especially to George Harrison who distributed fliers for our upcoming&nbsp;<b><a href="http://www.liffeyvalleyac.com/archive/TBM5kmNewYearsDayRace2008.pdf">Tom Brennan Memorial 5km Race on New Years Day</a></b></p> <p>Most athletes now have their sights firmly focussed on the National Novice in Dungarvan on 16th December where we hope to see some more good runs from the lads &amp; ladies to end 2007 on a high.</p> <p><strong>Liz</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>|jinglebells2007.html||2010-02-23 12:48:49.750000000|1

Not too far behind was&nbsp;Mairead Murphy&nbsp;in 12th position, 4th in the M40 category.&nbsp;Una Reilly&nbsp;was next athlete home in 23rd position, claiming silver in the M55 category, just beaten to gold by&nbsp;Margaret McCreery.&nbsp;Siobhan Donachie&nbsp;was next home in 24th place. A good performance from the Team ended in 6th place.</p> <p>Next off was the Mens race with 3.5 laps.&nbsp;Tom O'Connor&nbsp;quickly settled into contention within a group of five athletes, with 6 other club mates behind. With half a lap to go,&nbsp;Tom&nbsp;opened a gap from&nbsp;Eoghan Brady&nbsp;and maintained his lead to the end, winning in 24.24.</p> <p>Paul, John&nbsp;and&nbsp;Pat&nbsp;also enjoyed gold in their M35, M55 and M60 categories. With&nbsp;Martin&nbsp;and&nbsp;Gerry&nbsp;coming home in 22nd and 24th, silver was claimed in the Team event.&nbsp;Paul Power&nbsp;had a great run in his first competive race in 3 years, just behind the legend JC.</p> <p class="main">There was again great support from the club around the course, which gave everyone the encouragement needed to push all the way to the finish.</p> <p><a href="http://www.liffeyvalleyac.com/archive/results/2007-2008/Dublin%20MastersXC2008.xls">Click here for full results</a></p> <p><a href="http://www.liffeyvalleyac.com/archive/gallery/2008/dublinmastersxc2008.pdf">Click here for Photos</a></p>|dublinmastersxc2008.html||2010-05-13 00:55:42.240000000|1

60|1|2007 Leinster Intermediate Cross Country Championships|Ballinakill, Co.Laois |2007-11-11 00:00:00|<p>Liffey Valley athletes headed to Haywood College in Ballinakill, Co Laois for the Leinster Intermediate cross country on Sunday 12th November last. In cold but dry conditions the ladies race kicked off proceedings for the club. The ladies race was 4,000m, 2 laps of a very hilly course. Unfortunately only 3 ladies could race today so we did not have a complete Liffey Valley ladies team. However, this did not deter the efforts of the girls &amp;&nbsp;<strong>Siobhan</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Marj</strong>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<strong>Ashling</strong>each worked hard over this tough course. Siobhan was first LVAC lady home in 43rd position, Marj &amp; Ashling followed shortly behind with another powerful finish from Marj similar to that in the Dublin intermediate a few weeks ago. They finished in 47th &amp; 50th places respectively.</p> <p>However, after stunning performances of the ladies in the marathon 2 weeks ago, today it was the men&rsquo;s turn to steal the limelight. With 7 Liffey Valley men competing, and 4 of them also on the Dublin team, they set off over the 10K course determined to run hard.&nbsp;<strong>Lea</strong>&nbsp;took the race from the front &amp; kept with the leading pack throughout the race finishing in a superb 9th position and 3rd man home for Dublin.&nbsp;<strong>Ciaran Reilly</strong>&nbsp;followed closely behind, fighting hard over each lap to achieve a hotly contested spot on the Dublin team with a view to breaking through to the senior ranks. Of course he did have the added incentive of needing to free up a few weekends next November for another very special event&hellip;.Thankfully for everyone, Ciaran&rsquo;s efforts paid off &amp; he finished in 20th position and was 6th man home for Dublin.</p> <p>Next home for LVAC were&nbsp;<strong>Viktor</strong>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<strong>Javier</strong>, who paced each other over the first couple of laps. Viktor however pulled away but was never too far from Javier&rsquo;s sights. They finished in 27th &amp; 29th places respectively &amp; claimed team bronze for the club.&nbsp;<strong>Ray Boyle</strong>&nbsp;next man home ran a stormer of a race to finish in front of&nbsp;<strong>Mick Dunne</strong>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<strong>Martin Dorgan</strong>. It was thanks to the effort of the complete squad that LVAC took bronze &amp; full credit must go to all the lads for their hard work on this very challenging course.</p> <p>So it was another remarkable day for Liffey Valley where the lads claimed bronze for the club, and Lea &amp; Ciaran helped Dublin to gold &amp; in doing so have now broken through to Senior in Cross Country. No sooner were the results announced but the mobiles were produced to pass on the good news to Coach&nbsp;<strong>Jim Davis</strong>&nbsp;who was in Tilburg, Holland as Head coach to the Irish squad out there, which included club man&nbsp;<strong>Danny Darcy</strong>. Good news coming back was that Danny finished 5th in the U23 event on a very tough course. Well done Danny&hellip;Watch out for him in the Inter Counties in the Curragh in 2 weeks time&hellip;</p> <p>Overall this was a fantastic achievement for the all the lads &amp; surely will give them great confidence in advance of the next major championship event, the National Novice on 16th December where both the ladies &amp; men will compete.</p> <p>Today the athletes were helped along the way by plenty of supporters who surprisingly enough for the Dubs managed to find they way outside The Pale &amp; successfully navigated their way into the countryside to Ballinakill.&nbsp;<br /> Not so lucky however was one LVAC Laois native, who went slightly astray but thankfully made it there just in time for the race&hellip;perhaps a compass might be in order for the even trickier journey to Dungarvan on 16th Dec!!<br /> Thanks also to Coach&nbsp;<strong>Nick</strong>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<strong>Pat</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Jimmy</strong>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<strong>Martin</strong>&nbsp;for making to effort to travel.</p> <p><strong>Liz</strong></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.liffeyvalleyac.com/archive/gallery/2007/LeinsterIntermediateXC2007.pdf">Click here for photos</a></b></p>|leinsterinterxc2007.html||2010-05-13 00:54:48.307000000|1

142|1|Tom Brennan Memorial 5km Race |Phoenix Park|2006-01-01 00:00:00|<p class="main"><b>James Nolan</b> began the New Year in fine style with a fine run to win the Tom Brennan trophy race in the Phoenix Park in a new course record of <b>14'39</b> knocking some 35 seconds off the course record with Mullingars <b>Mark Christie</b> in second spot clocking <b>14'50</b> ahead of <b>Fintan McGee</b> of Lucan. <b>Annette Kealy</b> of Raheny won the womens race in <b>17'25</b> some 16 seconds ahead of Olympic Rower <b>Sinead Jennings</b> with <b>Claire Phelan</b> of St. Abban's third.</p> <p class="main">In ideal conditions on the two lap course Nolan and Christie had detached themselves from the remainder of the field after 800 metres. By the end of the first circuit the Mullungar man Christie was trying to make stamina pay as he tried to take it along but James Nolan was sitting in very comfortably. Meanwhile some 100 metres behind there was an interesting battle in progress for third spot with last years winner Gary Hynes, Paul Fleming and Fintan McGee running together.</p> <p class="main">The longer Nolan stayed in contact the more inevitable the result became as with 400 metres to go he moved up a gear and the young Mullingar man had no response and moved right away to win in a very creditable <b>14'39</b> fine running for a man more suited to shorter distances and an indication of his current well being at this stage of the year. For Mark Christie in his first senior season it was a good start to the new year and his progress will be watched with interest. Fintan McGee in third spot had a his best run ever at this level as he held off last years winner Gary Hynes. Annette Kealy ran strongly throughout to finish some 16 seconds ahead of Sinead Jennings who has forsaken the water for the roads and continued her promising season. St. Abbans Calire Phelan was another athlete who had a promising start to the season.</p> <p class="main">Rathfarnham won the mens team race with Raheny taking the womens race.

Over the final 250 metres Mairead started to pull away and quickly opened up a gap which she continued to extend to the finish.

Marjorie Twomey was some 25 metres behind Christine Roche with 200 to go when she began a long sprint for home.</p> <p>She powered around the final bend and was closing rapidly and her surperior strength told in the last few metres as she edged ahead of Christine to take the bronze medal.</p> <p>Ciaran Reilly took up the running from the start of the mens race as he took the field along reaching the bell in 60secs.

66|1|2008 AAI Senior Cross Country Championships|Belfast|2008-03-01 00:00:00|<p>On Sunday the 1st March, Liffey Valley athletes travelled to Belfast for the National Senior Cross Country Championship (first time since 1966).</p> <p>On the same course that a few years ago(1999) saw Paul Tergat, Paulo Guerra and a junior Paula Radcliffe among others, our athletes produced some great performances. Some muddy areas besides a deep hill made a tough 12 km race as the times shows.</p> <p class="main">The weather was cold and windy but the forecasted rain thankfully held off..</p> <p>Liffey Valley was represented in the men&rsquo;s Senior race by Tom O&rsquo;Connor, Paul Balfe, Sean Dowling, Ciaran Reilly, Pierce Geoghegan and Lea Fulcher.</p> <p>In the first lap, the hill made everyone settle into the pace .. Lea and Tom were leading the team during the first lap closely followed by Pierce, Sean, Ciaran and Paul.</p> <p>Using his experience, Tom picked up places as the race went through up to finish in a fantastic 42nd place (on the first page of the official results which is always good as he reckoned later). Lea was next (53rd) with a strong performance, especially during the last two laps. Pierce made another excellent run (58th) to add to his list of fine performances in this year&rsquo;s cross country season. To complete the team, Paul made a fine performance placing him very well. He was picking up places during the six laps to finish in a good 68th place.</p> <p>The team was well supported by Ciaran (78th) and Sean (80th). Ciaran made an impressive run gaining some good places during the second half of the race. Hope he will fully recover for next weekend at the Leinster Indoor Championships. Sean ran well too although we had missed a few weeks of training. Well done to both!</p> <p>After those impressive performances, Coach Jim Davis reckoned that we may get a medal in B category. He was not wrong as Liffey Valley got silver with 221 points, finishing in 6th place overall.</p> <p>What a great finish for the cross country season!!</p> <p>That proved that all work done during the winter was well pointed.</p> <p>Again a few supporters were spread out around the challenging course of the Queen&rsquo;s University. Fair play to them!</p> <p>All in all, a great day of athletics with Liffey Valley shining at the highest level.</p> <p>Javier Silvan&nbsp;</p> <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.liffeyvalleyac.com/archive/gallery/2008/aaiseniorxc2008.pdf">Photos by Pat Collins</a></p>|aaiinterseniorxc08.html||2010-05-13 00:49:32.260000000|1

Other notable performances for the club included&nbsp;<strong>Mick Dunne</strong>&nbsp;achieving a PB, taking almost 1 min off his previous best.

68|1|2008 AAI Intermediate and Masters Cross Country Championships|Piercetown, Co. Wexford|2008-02-10 00:00:00|<p>Liffey Valley athletes headed to Wexford on Sunday last for the penultimate race of the 07/08 Cross Country Championship season. The sunny south east lived up to its reputation with conditions ideal for the event. However the difficulties encountered with the mud in Santry at this event last year were equalled this year by the challenge of the hills on this very tough course.</p> <p>However, in the first race of the day, Una Reilly in the Ladies Masters event ran a tremendous race to capture the silver in the W50 category. Una has been on somewhat of a wining streak recently taking silver in the Dublin Masters &amp; knocking out PB&rsquo;s in almost every race in recent times.</p> <p>Unfortunately due to illness &amp; injuries, on this occasion the intermediate ladies were unable to field a team. Nonetheless, Siobhan kept the flag flying for the ladies and ran strongly over the tough 4K in a highly competitive field. Well done Siobhan&hellip;</p> <p>Next up was the Men's Masters event. Dublin Masters winner Tom O&rsquo;Connor lead the Liffey Valley men home and was unlucky to finish just outside the medals and was 4th in his category. He was followed home by Paul Balfe who gained great ground over the 7K race. Martin Dorgan produced probably his best ever cross country run &amp; stormed around the 4 laps finishing as strongly as he started. Gerry Daly, John Cullen &amp; Pat Collins followed closely behind &amp; it was with great applause that John was presented with silver in the M55 &amp; Pat received bronze in the M60 category. The team finished a very strong 7th position out of a large field of 17 teams.</p> <p>The main feature of the day, the Intermediate Men's race was won in a very convincing fashion by Dan Mulhare from North Laois in a time of 33.05. Liffey Valley&rsquo;s Danny Darcy stayed with the main pack for the first 5K of the 10K race &amp; held on to take 6th place overall in a time of 34.03. Pierce Geoghegan who is going from strength to strength finished in 31st place in a time of 36.20. Pierce has been running consistently well over the whole season and should be very pleased with his performance on Sunday. The rest of the lads, Lea, Viktor &amp; Andy packed in well behind Danny &amp; Pierce &amp; achieved good times &amp; places over such a demanding course. The team finished in 4th position, somewhat unlucky to miss out on the bronze by only a few points. It demonstrates what potential is there for the lads considering 2 key players Ciaran Reilly &amp; Javier Silvan were missing due to illness &amp; injury. Well done lads on such a great achievement.</p> <p>Once again many Liffey Valley supporters arrived on the day to cheer on their club mates &amp; thanks to all those for making the effort.</p> <p>Next on the horizon is the Masters Indoors next weekend in Nenagh &amp; then the highlight of the 07/08 Cross Country season, the National Senior in Belfast on 1st March. Good luck to all those competing.</p> <p>Watch the website for upcoming club races also...</p> <p>Liz</p> <p><b><a href="http://www.liffeyvalleyac.com/archive/results/2007-2008/AAIInterWomen2008.pdf">Women Inter Results</a></b></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.liffeyvalleyac.com/archive/results/2007-2008/AAIMastersWomen2008.pdf">Women Master Results</a></b></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.liffeyvalleyac.com/archive/results/2007-2008/AAIInterMen2008.pdf">Mens Inter Results</a></b></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.liffeyvalleyac.com/archive/results/2007-2008/AAIMastersMen2008.pdf">Mens Master Results</a></b></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.liffeyvalleyac.com/archive/gallery/2008/aaiintermasterswomenxc2008.pdf">Click here for Photos - Women's</a></b></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.liffeyvalleyac.com/archive/gallery/2008/aaiintermastersxc2008.pdf">Click here for Photos - Men's</a></b></p>|aaiintermastersxc08.html||2010-05-13 00:53:16.920000000|1

77|1|2008 Clonliffe Harriers 2 Mile Road Race|Finglas to Glasnevin|2008-05-05 00:00:00|<p>Liffey Valley claimed the Men's Team Race in this year's race, held on the traditional course. A strong breeze blew against the leading bunch, although in a tactical race setup for the sprinters at the end, the first mile went out at a slow pace, with 9.54 being called at the 1m 100m mark.&nbsp;<strong>Ciaran, Tom</strong>&nbsp;and then&nbsp;<strong>Paul</strong>&nbsp;lead the race until the last half mile where the top 4 athletes gathered for a sprint finish at the end. These were good performances from the Team, despite the slow times. Then news came through of the Novice Team's success in Gowran, making the May Bank Holiday a great day for the club.</p> <p><strong>Clonliffe Race Report:</strong></p> <p>&quot;The 117th Clonliffe 2 mile road race was run today in magnificent sunshine. 84 athletes toed the line at the Bottom of the Hill pub in Finglas and made their way downhill for the fast first mile. The front runners appeared to be holding back a little and the real race didn't start until the uphill section. By the time they got to the last corner before the turn in to the finish line at the Gravediggers pub in Glasnevin, there was not much to seperate the front four. David Flynn, leading junior struggled to stay with the senior pace and Tom Fitzpatrick from Tallaght was next to be dropped. With 200m to go Rory McDonnell of Dunboyne made his move, but Paul Fleming (Rathfarnham) tracked him all the way, and a titanic battle ensued. In the end Paul's renowned sprint finish saw him take victory in 9.36, with Rory just a second behind.</p> <p class="main">Annette Kealy was first female home, while Liffey Valley won the Men's team prize by a single point from Dunboyne. In the Ladies team even, Sportsworld and Clonliffe both scored 110 points, but Sportsworld took 1st place on countback. David Flynn and Kate Purcell from the hosting club were Junior winners on the day.&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="http://www.clonliffeharriers.com/images/photos/2008/May/2Mile/album/"><strong>Race Photos Here</strong></a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>|clonliffe2008.html||2010-05-13 00:47:58.180000000|1
78|1|2008 Leinster Novice Road |Gowran |2008-05-05 00:00:00|<p>&nbsp;</p> <p>On the May bank holiday, our novice team travelled to Gowran in Co. Kilkenny where the Leinster Novice Road Championship took place. The team was Lea Fulcher, Pierce Geoghegan, Andy Nason, Ray Boyle, Javier Silvan, Cian Cullinane and Liban Mohamed.</p> <p>Also Mick Dunne took part on the open race as he broke the Novice category in Tolerton last September by claiming gold in the team event.</p> <p>In perfect conditions (20 degrees and a pleasant breeze), the lads were ready to challenge a four laps course for a total of 6km.</p> <p>Right from the start, Lea set himself among the leaders, keeping up with them during the first half of this hilly race. Behind, the bright colours of the Liffey Valley singlet were well settled in the first third of the race. Unfortunately, Lea had to slow down his pace due to a stomach pain. Nevertheless, he managed to finish in a strong 9th place overall timing 19.48.</p> <p>He was well supported by Pierce and Andy who finished in 18th place overall (5th novice 20&rsquo;34) and 19th place (6th novice 20&rsquo;35) respectively. They had a good tussle and only in the last 200m, Pierce could beat the last year Winter League winner. Strong performance from Andy who confirmed his sharpness showed on the recent Avondale cup.</p> <p>The team of four was closed by Ray Boyle. Just back from an injury and having some knee problems, he managed to finish in 29th place (10th novice) timing 21.18 after a great finish.&nbsp;In between, Mick Dunne claimed a good 27th position overall clocking 21.16 Great run after being out of racing since Raheny 5 in late January.</p> <p>Javier finished in 41st place (18th novice) with a time of 22&rsquo;17 although he is still suffering form a hamstring injury. Just back from his holiday, Cian completed a good performance in 46th place (19th novice 22.44). And Liban who made his first novice race finishing in a good 63rd place (27th novice) timing 24.18</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As the race went through with Master and Open runners, it was difficult to know the results. However, the organization gave them out shortly and confirmed our hopes.</p> <p>Liffey Valley AC had won the Leinster Novice title with a total of 23 points beaten Slaney Olympic for 9 points.</p> <p>Also, all of them helped Dublin to win the Inter County Championship.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The gold men were Lea, Pierce, Andy and Ray.</p> <p>But that was not all: Lea Fulcher claimed silver in the individual Novice and Javier joined the gold list by scoring in the Dublin team.</p> <p>A sum of 10 medals ( 9 golds and 1 silver) showed how well we are conducted by our coaches.</p> <p>The news was well spread out, getting in response more medals from our team in the Cloniffe 2 miles. Ciaran Reilly(5th 9.48), Tom O&rsquo;Connor(6th 9.56) and Paul Balfe(7th 10.00) won the team prize.</p> <p>What a fantastic result!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A big thank you to Pat Collins for his continuous support giving a lift to some member of the team although he could not make the race due to a knee injury.</p> <p>We want to wish him a quick and fully recovery from injury.</p> <p>As Coach Jim Davis pointed - &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep it going on the track&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>Javier Silvan</strong> &ndash; May 6th 2008</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>|leinsternoviceroad2008.pdf||2010-05-13 00:48:13.383000000|1
79|1|LVAC Avondale Cup|Phoenix Park|2008-04-27 00:00:00|<p>Sunday 27th April 2008 marked the hosting of the 54th year of the Avondale cup 4 mile road race. Held in glorious weather conditions, hopefully marking the beginning of summer, the 23 athletes certainly turned a few heads racing around the Furze road, Main Road &amp; Ordnance survey road lap.</p> <p>The Avondale cup race is one of the highlights of the Liffey Valley racing calendar with all club athletes keen to win this during their running career and have their names inscribed on the coveted cup. The cup dates back to 1954 when it was first won by Jimmy Douglas, a member of Avondale AC. It predates the merger of Inchicore AC &amp; Avondale AC who later became Liffey Valley AC. Jimmy was present once again this year, looking as fit as ever as he made his way round the course to offer encouragement &amp; support to the current members of the club.</p> <p>Speculation was rife in the club in the weeks building up to the big race&hellip;everyone watching the form of their club mates to see who was going well &amp; who was likely to get a &lsquo;good handicap&rsquo; . However, with Nick &amp; Jim in charge of the handicap times, one could always be assured that those times would be accurate to the second!</p> <p>11.30am marked kick off &amp; one by one the athletes headed off around the 2 lap course. After lap one, officials made their way to the top of the Furze road, gauging the form &amp; placing of the athletes as they passed by after the first lap. Already looking impressive were a number of athletes including Andy Nason, Ciaran Reilly, Martin Dorgan &amp; Siobhan Donachie, with all having made up ground on those in front. However, shortly after, word filtered through that Siobhan had taken the lead on the Ordnance survey. With eyes strained, the first yellow singlet came through the bollards on the furze road&hellip;Was it Andy Nason or was it Paul Tucker??</p> <p>Oh hang on, no, it was Siobhan Donachie! But the question was, could she hold on for the tough 800m up the Furze road to the finish??? Siobhan, a leading member of the Liffey valley ladies team ran with guts &amp; determination to hold off the challenge of 2nd place finisher, Paul Tucker, who hails all the way from Australia. In a very exciting sprint finish between both athletes, Siobhan was never going to give up fighting for this title &amp; in doing so set herself a new PB of 26.17, knocking over a minute off her previous PB. Siobhan has been a consistent and dedicated athlete who rarely misses a race or a training session so it was unanimously agreed that there could not be a more deserving winner.</p> <p>It was with rapturous applause that Siobhan later accepted the cup from club chairman Malcolm Edger. Siobhan is only the second lady in history to win the cup, taking over the title from Eithne Dorgan who made it into the history books last year. Eithne was unable to defend her title this year as she is about to add a new member to the club, but has promised to give us all a run for our money next year! It was with a mixture of sadness &amp; joy that Eithne parted with the cup, sad to see it go, but delighted with it being retained by the ladies &amp; more so by her good friend &amp; club mate, Siobhan. Siobhan was obviously inspired by Eithne&rsquo;s performance last year &amp; was determined to have &lsquo;Donachie&rsquo; engraved on the cup before she marries Ciaran Reilly later in the year. A special place will now be made at the top table &amp; she has promised that the cup will be filled at the wedding!!</p> <p>This year the cup almost got a trip to Oz but it will have to be content with another mantlepiece in Lucan where I&rsquo;m sure it will receive as much attention &amp; admiration as it did last year...</p> <p>Well done to all athletes who participated today, to Paul who finished a gallant 2nd &amp; Andy Nason, last years Winter League Champion in 3rd. Fastest on the day was Ciaran who completed the 4 miles in 21 mins.</p> <p>Thanks also to all those who came along to help &amp; support, Malcolm, Jim Davis, Jimmy Douglas, Liam, George, Pat, Arnaud,Lorcan, Kathryn, Mairead, Majella, Eithne, Ciara &amp; Liz. It was a great day &amp; we look forward to many more similar occasions in the future.</p> <p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=83464&amp;id=1554646774&amp;saved#!/album.php?aid=83464&amp;id=1554646774">View Photos on Facebook</a></p> <p>Liz</p>|Avondale2008.pdf||2011-06-06 22:24:08.580000000|1
81|1|2008 LVAC 1500m & 3000m Track Championships |ALSAA|2008-06-19 00:00:00|<p>Five ladies braved the torrential downpour and took to the line in the Club 1,500m Track Championships in ALSAA on 19th June last. In weather more akin to that of the depths of winter they set off for the 1500m race. Mairead Murphy &amp; Siobhan Donachie battled it out over the first two laps when last years champion, Mairead pulled away to take another club 1500m gold &amp; smashed her time from last year by 14 seconds in the process. Siobhan also kept up her good form of the track season to date &amp; finished in a time of 5.34, again a significant improvement on last year. By holding the race a few weeks earlier this year, it meant that teacher, Marjorie Twomey had not yet headed back to the Rebel County for the summer sojourn &amp; allowed her to pick up the bronze medal in a time of 5.45. Newcomer Hilary Cadigan finished 4th in this her first race with Liffey Valley. It was a great achievement from Hilary &amp; we hope to see her on the track in ALSAA in the future again! Liz completed the finishers in the ladies race taking 5th spot.</p> <p>The men&rsquo;s race proved to be a tactical affair with Lea Fulcher taking the lead from the gun. Lea, who favours the longer distances attempted to take the race from the front &amp; pull away from 800m track star, Ciaran Reilly. Lea ran a very impressive race but in the end couldn&rsquo;t hold off the very strong finish from Ciaran who set another new PB &amp; finished in 9.01.6. If it&rsquo;s any consolation to Lea, the race was won by Ciaran in 9.14 last year &amp; with Lea&rsquo;s time of 9.06.8 this time round, who knows what&rsquo;s on the cards next year! Well done to both the lads on showing us a great race. Veteran Legend, Tom O Connor took the bronze medal in 9.24 holding off the challenge of new Dad, Martin Dorgan, who, despite his sleep depravation finished in a time of 9.28.8, only a second off last years time.</p> <p>Down the field, the sprint finish of the night went to Pat Collins who overcame Martin Callaghan in the race for line. Javier, suffering from a back injury at present, must be commended on his attempts to race in the first instance. Likewise it was great to see Eddie McGrath in the Liffey Valley vest again after his long stint of injury.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Paul Balfe, last years silver medallist wasn&rsquo;t as lucky &amp; was unable to compete but did get the honours of presenting the medals to the winners afterwards in his capacity of Treasurer of the Club.</p> <p>Thanks also to Nick, Kathryn &amp; Jimmy who braved the rain &amp; cold to steward the race, we really appreciate it, especially in such horrible weather!</p> <p>Well done to all who took part!</p> <p>Liz</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Club Championship Results</b></p> <p><b>Womens 1500m</b></p> <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="80%">     <colgroup><col width="10%" /><col width="50%" /><col width="10%" /><col width="10%" /><col width="10%" /><col width="10%" /></colgroup>     <tbody>         <tr>             <th>Rank</th>             <th>Athlete</th>             <th>             <div align="center">Finishing Time</div>             </th>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>1</td>             <td>Mairead Murphy</td>             <td>             <div align="center">5.18</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>2</td>             <td>Siobhan Donachie</td>             <td>             <div align="center">5.34</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>3</td>             <td>Marj Twomey</td>             <td>             <div align="center">5.45</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>4</td>             <td>Hilary Cadigan</td>             <td>             <div align="center">6.56</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>5</td>             <td>Liz Ryan</td>             <td>             <div align="center">7.06</div>             </td>         </tr>     </tbody> </table> <p><b>Mens 3000m</b></p> <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="80%">     <colgroup><col width="10%" /><col width="50%" /><col width="10%" /><col width="10%" /><col width="10%" /><col width="10%" /></colgroup>     <tbody>         <tr>             <th>Rank</th>             <th>Athlete</th>             <th>             <div align="center">Finishing Time</div>             </th>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>1</td>             <td>Ciaran Reilly</td>             <td>             <div align="center">9.01.6</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>2</td>             <td>Lea Fulcher</td>             <td>             <div align="center">9.06.8</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>3</td>             <td>Tom O'Connor</td>             <td>             <div align="center">9.24.0</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>4</td>             <td>Martin Dorgan</td>             <td>             <div align="center">9.28.8</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>5</td>             <td>Pierce Geoghegan</td>             <td>             <div align="center">9.42.9</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>6</td>             <td>Mick Dunne</td>             <td>             <div align="center">9.55.3</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>7</td>             <td>John Cullen</td>             <td>             <div align="center">10.20.7</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>8</td>             <td>Larry Callaghan</td>             <td>             <div align="center">10.50.5</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>9</td>             <td>Pat Collins</td>             <td>             <div align="center">11.00.8</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>10</td>             <td>Martin Callaghan</td>             <td>             <div align="center">11.01.9</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>11</td>             <td>Javier Silvan</td>             <td>             <div align="center">11.06.0</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>12</td>             <td>Eddie McGrath</td>             <td>             <div align="center">11.06.3</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>13</td>             <td>John Parker</td>             <td>             <div align="center">11.47.0</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>14</td>             <td>Joe Cooper</td>             <td>             <div align="center">12.12.4</div>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>&nbsp;</td>             <td>&nbsp;</td>             <td>&nbsp;</td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td>DNF</td>             <td>Paul Power</td>             <td>DNF</td>         </tr>     </tbody> </table>|lvac1500m_3000m2008.html||2010-05-13 00:46:29.017000000|1

279|1|AAI Senior Cross Country|Tullamore|2013-02-24 00:00:00|<p>The rolling fields of Charleville Castle provided the backdrop for a historic day for the club as both means and women&rsquo;s teams won category awards in the National Senior Inter Club Cross Country Championships on Sunday last Feb. 24th.&nbsp; It was a perfect day for running with fine weather and a 2km lap that was dry and fast.<br /> <br /> It was the first time that we had a women&rsquo;s team competing at this level and for all it was the longest cross country race they had ever run. Leona O&rsquo;Reilly lead the team home followed by Mairead Murphy, Lena Sinclair and Sile Carroll who had a great battle with Louise O&rsquo;Brien to hold on to the fourth scoring place with Clare Brett completing the team. The team was second in Grade &ldquo;C&rdquo; and 9th. overall.</p> <p>Six laps of the testing circuit, which was relatively dry given the winter we have had, had to be completed for the men&rsquo;s 12k. Michael McCarthy led the team home followed by Mike Griffin with Arnoud Benjacar edging out Club Chairman Brendan Beere for the 4th. scoring position 2 places ahead of Paul Balfe with Mohamed Dahir and Roman Soltys completing the team. The team finished second in Grade &ldquo;B&rdquo; and 11th overall.</p> <p>30th.&nbsp;&nbsp; Leona O&rsquo;Reilly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 32.31<br /> 48th.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mairead Murphy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 34.23<br /> 49th&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lena Sinclair&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 34.31<br /> 58th.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sile Carroll&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 36.32<br /> 60th. &nbsp; Louise Griffin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 36.52<br /> 61st&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clare Brett&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 37.05</p> <p>47th&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mike McCarthy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 43.12<br /> 60th&nbsp;&nbsp; Mike Griffin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 44.18<br /> 70th&nbsp;&nbsp; Arnaud Benjacar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 45.43<br /> 71st&nbsp;&nbsp; Brendan Beere&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 45.57<br /> 73rd&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul Balfe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 46.12<br /> 81st &nbsp;&nbsp; Mohamed Dahir&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 47.22<br /> 83rd&nbsp;&nbsp; Roman Soltys&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 47.32</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>|inter-club-cross-country-2013.xls||2013-02-26 18:31:46.917000000|1

20|1|2008 Leinster Novice & Masters Cross Country|Avondale, Co. Wicklow|2008-10-26 00:00:00|<p>On Sunday 26th October, the Leinster Novice Cross Country Championship took place on the grounds of the Avondale House in Co. Wicklow. The course was the same as previous years, including the many well known climbs. This time however, the descents were also challenging due to the bad conditions of the trails, which were very slippy in some parts.</p> <p>Surprisingly, the men&rsquo;s race didn&rsquo;t start as quickly as usual and it was Lea Fulcher who took the lead, pushing on during the first part of the three lap race. As the race went through, everyone found a place to fight for, being easy to spot the Liffey Valley singlets well positioned throughout the field. Lea was first man home, finishing in 7th place. His downhill running was remarkable where he gained a few good places. Pierce was next, completing another excellent performance. Taking places in each lap, he claimed 13th place. Sean Dowling came next in a brilliant race to finish 17th, closely followed by Ciaran in 20th place, who recovered from two falls in the downhill section. Andy just a few metres behind, finished in 23rd place completing his best performance of the season although it is a really busy time for him. Best wishes on his new baby due in the coming days.</p> <p>Richard Oakley completed another fine performance and finished 48th, followed by newcomer Dermot Sullivan in 50th place. Cian Cullinane was next in 52nd place, with Liban Mohamed in 55th place and John Parker in 56th place. Good performances from all of them.</p> <p>Liffey Valley Novice Men team claimed 2nd place in the team classification, just 7 points behind the winners Rathfarnham WSAF. This was a great result for the team which confirms the good start to the season and a huge improvement on last year&rsquo;s 4th place. Furthermore, Lea, Pierce and Ciaran scored for Dublin and claimed gold in the county classification.</p> <p>With regard to the Master Championship, unfortunately, we could not field a team in either men or women. However, both Una Reilly and Pat Collins, claimed gold in their respective age groups. What a result!</p> <p>Una went off fast but it was in the final lap when she would gain places and finished in 22nd place overall and 1st O55.</p> <p>Pat also had a quick start, especially in the first half of the race. His impressive time of 26.10 (unofficial time. No results available yet) in the same three lap course that the seniors did before, shows his amazing level of fitness. He finished 1st place in O60&hellip;a great inspiration for everyone.</p> <p>All in all, a great day of cross country in an amazing scenery with Liffey Valley singlets shining in medal spots. We must thank and congratulate Coaches Nick Davis and Jim Davis for their coaching and the good number of supporters who made the trip to Wicklow.</p> <p>Javier<br /> &nbsp;</p>|leinsternovicexc2008.pdf||2010-05-13 00:42:48.953000000|1
27|1|LVAC Cake Race|Phoenix Park|2008-12-20 00:00:00|<p class="main">33 Liffey Valley Athletes arrived at the Dog Pond in full festive mood for the beginning of the 2008 Cake Race. Thankfully the storm on Friday had passed off leaving nothing only a nice mucky course for our traditional Christmas 3 mile race.</p> <p class="main">The girls had been privy to an advance peep at the Christmas cake prize on offer, iced &amp; decorated in Liffey Valley colours by Marj &amp; Mairead. Of course with Nick &amp; Jim compiling the handicaps for this race, one could never predict who the eventual winner would be. That would not stop the speculation though!</p> <p class="main">The race kicked off at 11.30 with athletes facing 2 x 1.5 mile laps of the Dog Pond. Whilst the mucky conditions were a challenge for some, being there for 11.30am given the &lsquo;Christmas spirits&rsquo; was a challenge for others! However Hilary got matters underway and the serious business of winning the cake began. After lap 1 the handicap was diminishing with some having caught those in front at that stage. However, as usual the real excitement began with the athletes coming through the trees with a mile to go. Stewards peeled their eyes to see who was in contention &amp; <strong>Lena&rsquo;s</strong> pink cap confirmed she was in first place &amp; going strong. Christine, the winner of the club 4-mile cross-country, was in second position at that stage. However, as the race progressed around the bottom of the cricket grounds, the image of <strong>Tom O'Connor</strong> appeared like an express train, eating up the ground before him. He eventually caught <strong>Lena</strong> with 50 meters to go &amp; both athletes finished hand in hand for a joint victory. A magnificent run from both, with Tom having started at the very rear of the handicap &amp; overtaking everybody else in the field. <strong>Lena</strong> won her first ever cross country club race &amp; it could not have happened to two more deserving winners. Certainly ones to watch for the Club Cross Country Championship race after Christmas.</p> <p class="main">Ciaran Reilly sufficiently recovered from his honeymoon in South Africa finished in 3rd position, followed by Christine in 4th &amp; Aonghus in 5th.</p> <p class="main">The presentation of the cake took place in the club house with all athletes who participated taking home a prize. It was a great occasion for all those who competed, with Majella &amp; Mark, racing for the first time since recovering from their respective year long injuries. It was Carole Stone&rsquo;s first race with the club &amp; we hope to see her at many more in the future. It was great to see Michelle Geoghegan was there to support her club mates &amp; we certainly hope to see her back running soon after her cycling accident during the year.</p> <p class="main">Thanks once again to Nick &amp; Jim for all their work in not only this race, but for all their efforts throughout the year. Nick was assisted stewarding by Kathryn, John Cullen, Malcolm &amp; AAI &lsquo;Assistant of the Year&rsquo; winner, Tom McCormack.</p> <p class="main">Club Multi terrain takes place Sat 27th next &amp; members are also asked to report for stewarding at the Tom Brennan New Years Day race.</p> <p class="main">On behalf of all the committee, Malcolm wished all a very Happy Christmas&hellip;</p> <p class="main"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=83464&amp;id=1554646774&amp;saved#!/liffeyvalleyac?v=photos">View Photos on Facebook</a></p> <p class="main">Liz</p>|lvaccake2008results.pdf||2010-12-30 16:04:30.627000000|1

22|1|2008 Dublin Intermediate Cross Country|Tymon Park, Dublin|2008-10-12 00:00:00|<p>Proceedings shifted to Tymon Park in Tallaght on 12th October for the Dublin Intermediate Cross Country. Once again, ideal racing conditions prevailed with the race being held on the same course as last year.</p> <p>The ladies 4000m race got the events underway. Lena Sinclair led the Liffey Valley team home in 9th position with Christine Roche having a strong performance particularly in the 2nd half of the race. Marj Twomey was next home after battling it out with newcomer Aoife Sweeney. She managed to overtake Aoife in the last 100m. Aoife had a very strong run &amp; shows great potential for the future. No doubt she will be better prepared for Marj&rsquo;s legendary sprint finishes on the next occasion!! Mairead Creedon made the trip up from Cork to complete the Liffey Valley team &amp; well done to her on her performance. The Team finished 4th overall with Lena qualifying to run for Dublin in the Leinster Intermediate in Abbelyeix on 9th November next. Well done to all!</p> <p>The men&rsquo;s 8000m race was next up, with the boys hoping to match or better their silver medals from this race last year. Once again, the race got off to a very fast start with Lea, Ciaran &amp; Pierce in the leading bunch from the gun. As the race spread out the boys remained up front &amp; Andy Nason fought hard all the way around to take every place possible. Always knowing they were in contention for medals the pressure was on not to lose concentration &amp; slip back. There was much Liffey Valley support lining the course &amp; the boys were cheered on with gusto. Richard Oakley, Liban, Cian &amp; John were having their own battles down the field knowing that every place would count in this race. It was great to see Richard Oakley back racing after a very serious climbing accident over a year ago &amp; no doubt he will be flying again when his favoured track season returns. On this occasion Lea was once again first home in 11th position, followed by Ciaran Reilly in 13th having had a very strong last lap, and Pierce Geoghegan just 3 seconds behind in 14th. Andy was the fourth scorer on the team in 32nd place.</p> <p>The result equalled their performance from 2007 &amp; the boys were once again awarded the silver medals.

It was a great battle between <strong>Jimmy Monaghan</strong> &amp; <strong>Martin Wright</strong> coming down the Furze Road, until <strong>Eddie</strong> stormed past both of them to show that not only is he on his way back to his best form after injuries, but he has managed to get one over on the handicapper - that happens less often than winning this race...</p> <p class="main">It was a tremendous turnout by athletes and officials, with a stream of yellow singlets illuminating the Park on a day of good conditions. There were several personal bests achieved and many athletes returning to club racing.</p> <p class="main"><strong>Majella</strong> was first female athlete home, producing a kick finish to hold off her pursuers. <strong>Siobhan</strong> produced the fastest time of 27.26. <strong>Paul</strong> produced the fastest men's time of 19.50.</p> <p class="main"><strong>Ciaran Reilly </strong>clinched the 2005/6 Winter League title by holding off his nearest challengers.</p> <p class="main">Thanks to <strong>Liam, Tom, Dermot &amp; Kathryn </strong>for officiating at the race.</p>|avondale2006.html||2011-06-06 22:23:22.060000000|1
164|1|LVAC Avondale Cup|Dog Pond, Phoenix Park|2003-06-07 00:00:00|<p class="main">It was a cool morning in the Phoenix Park, making conditions near ideal for the small, but elite group of athletes who put the yellow singlet on. First to go was Nick Davis, followed shortly after by Jim Davis. Frank Novell soon sprinted after the front two and was pursued by reigning champion Paul McDonnell. As Arsene Wenger will admit, retaining your crown is much harder than the previous glory year, yet signs were good for Paul. Before he would set off, he checked the launch times of athletes to follow him and John Cullen, &quot;V3 beep beep&quot;, was the one most feared. JC set off 70 seconds later, with Kevin and Eddie chasing the entire field a minute or so later.</p> <p class="main">It was clear that Malcom and Jimmy would need to have electronic timing and photo finish cameras fully functional for the climax of this landmark event.</p> <p class="main">20 minutes later, with a full on view of the path towards the dog pond, a string of yellow vests zipped past - &quot;ar nos na gaoithe&quot;. An athlete in dark shorts had opened a gap of 10 meters ahead of John Cullen and just 100 meters from the line. No one knew who it was, could it be Paul Mac, or Eddie....whoever it was, would they hold off the challenge of the Roadrunner?</p> <p class="main">Well the answer was emphatic - just like the finishing sprint. There would be no last gasp collapse ala Albania, later that day to concede an injury time own goal to a poor Irish display in Landsdowne Road. No luck was needed, just pure grit and a couple of decades of determination to finally write his name onto that famous cup and Liffey Valley athletics history.</p> <p class="main"><b>Paddy Reilly</b> had arrived and as he warmed down, with a smile wider than the Bertie Straight, he ran shoulder to shoulder with John Cullen. &quot;Now I deserve to run beside John, at last&quot; grinned Paddy, just about willing to do it all over again if only the beaten had the heart of the victor.</p> <p class="main">Congratulations to <b>Paddy Reilly</b> on winning his first Avondale Cup, 22 years since joining the club!</p>|avondale2003.html||2011-06-06 22:26:41.963000000|1

Starting from the Ordinance Survey end, athletes had two complete laps to do after the first of 3 lengths of the smooth surface.</p> <p class="main">This race was also the last in the 2003/4 Winter League and this would be contested by <b>Frank Novell</b> &amp; <b>Paul Balfe. </b>Paul went into the race 10 points ahead in the table, but Frank was odds on favourite with Paddy Power to land his first title.</p> <p class="main">In the end, Frank was first across the line with a sprint finish from Pat.</p> <p class="main">Paul managed to get into 4th place, conceding 8 pts to Frank in the Winter League</p> <p class="main">Thanks to Jimmy for marking the new course, plus officiating along with John O'Reilly &amp; Malcolm.</p>|avondale2004.html||2011-06-06 22:30:00.187000000|1

284|1|LVAC 800m Track Championships|ALSAA|2013-06-20 00:00:00|<span>There were two very competitive races in ideal conditions in ALSAA well supported by club members. Two contrasting style of races but both very competitive.<br> <br> Siobhan Keenehan may have been second last year but she left now one in doubt about her intentions as she took the field along at a fast pace covering the first lap in 63 seconds. Both Leona O'Reilly and Sile Carroll were back in action after injury and illness were hanging on. With 300 to go Leona was just a few strides behind Siobhan looking like she was about to pounce. Siobhan had other ideas and around the final bend accelerated again and to take the title in a new personal best of 2m22.5s and also a personal best. Leona can be happy with her return to racing as indeed can Sile who also recorded a personal best.<br> <br> The Men's race was a more tactical battle an opening lap of 66 seconds saw Mike Griffin, Ciaran Reilly and Niall Coughlan lead the 26 athletes through the first lap. The order remained the same onto the finish straight where Ciaran was left behind with Mike on the inside holding of the challenge of Niall Coughlan who was getting into the medals for the first time both running faster on the second lap than the first. There were quite a few personal bests throughout the field with a number of new club members making their Liffey Valley debuts. </span>|LVAC800m2013.xls||2013-04-02 00:54:02.817000000|1

An indication of the positive approach by the girls was that Liffey Valley vests populated the leading bunch in the early stages and after 1000 metres Siobhan Keenehan led the squad, closely followed by Sile Carroll with Lena Sinclair close at hand. Aileen Gittens looked like she was determined to get into the scoring four as she was contesting places in the teens.<br> <br> Lena Sinclair made up some ground over the last 1500 metres and led the team in 9th place followed by Sile Carroll in 10th, with Siobhan Keenehan 11th. Aileen Gittens came through to finish 17th and complete the scoring. With Emer Nic an Bhaird 29th, Maeve Walsh 52nd and Christine Roche 65th.<br> <br> The team scored 48 points, seven ahead of Crusaders with Mullingar in third place. Lena and Siobhan also got two gold medals as they scored on the Dublin team with Sile opting to run for her native county Kilkenny and leading them home.<br> <br> Damian Couvet had his best run ever finishing 9th in 21.25 and leading the mens novice team home for 7th place in the team classification.<br> <br> The masters mens race was also over 6000 mtrs and Ciaran Reilly (21.57) was the first Liffey Valley man home in 18th place. John Cullen won the over 60 category and Pat Collins the over 65. The O40 team was 7th whilst the O50 squad were third in their category.<br> <br> Twenty three Liffey Valley athletes were in action and the tent team, lead by the indefatigable Tom McCormack, was very welcome keeping some of the elements at bay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  |||2013-11-03 00:54:02.817000000|1

As the race progressed Karen Crossan of Raheny took over at the front and Emer, Siobhan, Lena, Sheila and Aileen battled it out for the team places.<br> <br> Lena lead the team home in 8th , Siobhan next in 10th, Sile 11th and Emer 12th.

Ciaran Reilly was next in 12th.&nbsp; Brendan Beere was 17th with Darren Spring 18th. Paul Balfe was 19th Andy Nason 20th. Diarmaid O'Sullivan was 23rd.

Laois as the women's team continued their great season taking silver in the team championship with the means squad finishing in the bronze medal position.<br> <br> A testing 2k course which included a few hills provided a challenge for all and the women's 5k saw Raheny's Aoife Talty dominate the race with Leona contesting the silver and bronze medals positions for some of the race. While Leona was battling away at the front the next scoring places were being contested by all the team, the essence of good team running.<br> <br> At the finish Leona was 5th. with Eimear in 19th. the first time she occupied the second scoring position on the team. Lena in 20th just held off the fast finishing Sile and Aileen was just three places behind with Siobhan not having one of her better days in 27th.<br> Leona was also on the Dublin winning team so gold and silver on the day.<br> It has been quite a season for the women's team in Leinster winning the Novice and Intermediate titles and adding the Silver at Senior level a remarkable achievement given that some of the athletes are having their first ever cross country season.<br> <br> Five laps of the figure eight course was a testing 10k and Darren Spring was always hovering around the first ten from the start. Damian Cauvet ran his usual aggressive race with the smooth Mike Griffin inside the first 20 for some of the journey. With ten athletes contesting the scoring places there was some interesting battles. Darren led the team home in 9th. position, sixth scorer on the Dublin's winning team with Damian 14th. Mike 21st with Kieran Murray making his scoring debut in 26th. the 4th scorer.<br> Andy Nason came next in 30th. Gavin Curran held off Sean Dowling and Ciaran Reilly, Gerry Daly and Paul Balfe completed the team.</p>|||2013-04-02 00:54:02.817000000|1

80|1|2008 LVAC 800m Track Championship|ALSAA|2008-06-05 00:00:00|<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" height="100%">     <tbody>         <tr>             <td valign="top">             <p>On a damp evening in ALSAA the Club track championship season kicked off with the Men&rsquo;s &amp; Ladies 800m Championship races.</p>             <p>The Ladies race commenced proceedings with alas only 3 ladies competing. However, it was a quality field with all 3 ladies recording faster times than this race last year. Siobhan &amp; Christine having raced in the 800m Dublin Graded last Wednesday, set out with firm sights on the gold medal with Christine hoping to reverse the outcome from the graded. However, after 400m Siobhan had opened a 2 second gap on Christine &amp; Marj and went on to win in a time of 2.37, a significant improvement on her 2.44 winning time last year. The big finish of the night must go to Marj &amp; Christine. Marj made great progress over the last 200 to close the gap on Christine and in a magnificent 100m sprint finish both ladies battled hard for the line with Christine holding on to take the silver &amp; Marj the bronze. Well done to all 3 ladies.</p>             <p>The Men&rsquo;s race opened with great anticipation with Ciaran, Paul &amp; Martin taking the early lead. Unfortunately however, one of the main medal contenders, Paul Balfe, was forced out at 200m with a recurring hamstring problem. This left the race wide open for the remaining field. Ciaran, last years 800m champ, opened up a significant lead in the early stages &amp; was followed by Martin Dorgan, who had recovered from a very eventful previous 24 hours! Ray Boyle moved up the field into 3rd place and completed the 800 in a time of 2.16.2. Ciaran once again took the gold in 2.02.4, a vast improvement on his time of 2.05.25 last year.</p>             <p>Once again the golden couple, Siobhan &amp; Ciaran are the 800m Track Champions and take home 2 gold medals to accompany the Avondale Cup on the mantelpiece which Siobhan won in April. 2007 Cake Race winner, Ray Boyle taking bronze in the men&rsquo;s won his first ever club championship medal and was congratulated by both Nick &amp; Jim on this magnificent feat.</p>             <p class="main">However, the biggest cheer of the night undoubtedly went to Martin Dorgan who having won silver in the men&rsquo;s really took home top prize, as he became a Daddy for the first time a few hours previously. The club extends warmest wishes to both himself &amp; Eithne on this fabulous news, no doubt little junior will be one of Liffey Valley&rsquo;s biggest supporters in the years to come&hellip;and perhaps even a future 800m champion!<br />             Congratulations to the proud parents, Eithne &amp; Martin!</p>             <p>Thanks once again to Nick &amp; Jim for organising this evenings races &amp; for their tireless efforts with the club. It is testament to their training that both races were won in significantly faster times than last year and all athletes should be proud of their performances. Next Club championship race is the Ladies 1,500 &amp; Men&rsquo;s 3000 which take place in ALSAA on 19th June. We hope to see many more athletes in attendance on the night.</p>             <p>Thanks to Mairead, Liz, Nick, Jim &amp; Jimmy for officiating at the race.</p>             <p><b>Club Championship
