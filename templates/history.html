    <h2>The birth of Liffey Valley<br>
      <small>by Myles Cullen (founding chairman of LVAC)</small></h2>
    <p>The emergence of Liffey Valley Athletic Club in 1974 from Avondale
    A.C. and Inchicore A.C. was to me, as a former official of Inchicore A.C.
    and an Athlete, a means to an end, in-so-far as Terry Hayes, Gerry
    Kavanagh, Mick O'Callaghan, Paddy Conneff and myself had recognised the
    writing on the wall and realised that for the club to compete at a
    respectable level with the well known clubs i.e. Donore A.C., Clonliffe
    A.C., etc.. the Inchicore Club would need to amalgamate.</p>

    <p>The Inchicore Club were fortunate in having a very hardworking
    committee. A whole series of races for youth, from 14-18 years, were
    organised for Saturdays in the Phoenix Park, our aim was to increase club
    membership and have a good youth section, thereby ensuring the life of
    the club. Unfortunately, good youths and athletes were more attracted to
    the clubs which could provide good teams. In short our committed were
    good but they could only do so much. In my view, the final nail was
    driven in the coffin in the Eastern Region Intermediate C.C. (6 miles) in
    Co. Offaly.</p>

    <p>Our hopes were high, we felt we had a good team but were found wanting
    at the tail end of it. Mick O'Callaghan, Terry Hayes and myself finished
    in the first twenty and our 4th man came home around 90th. Low and
    behold, who beat us - yes you guessed it - Avondale A.C.</p>

    <p>The actual amalgamation of the clubs went very smoothly from our end.
    Terry Hayes with myself and the Davis Brothers (Nick & Jim) broke down
    many barriers while running the 10 mile lap in the 'Park'.</p>

    <p>When Inchicore A.C. and Avondale A.C. joined together, giving birth to
    Liffey Valley A.C., I felt happy with the new name. It was synonymous
    with the great clubs, i.e. Thames Valley, Lagan Valley, etc. It was a
    pleasure getting to know our new clubmates. The 'Maggots' McCormack, 'The
    Godfather' - John Fitzsimmons and the 'Original Scrooge' - Willie Hyland
    and many more, played their part in helping the club become the force it
    is now. When Avondale and Inchicore joined, we were pleasantly surprised
    to realise we had another training mate, EMILY HOPKINS-DOWLING, the
    numbers increased at the training sessions then and many a poor male
    athlete was put to shame, including myself.</p>

    <p>In exile, I often thought of my clubmates with their great camaraderie
    doing their training sessions. I would envy them. Memories flooded back.
    Who can ever forget the Fermoy Trip with the 'Pucan' Murray and he, using
    Guinness for fuel in the Middleton Road race, or the great singsong in
    the sheebeen in Cork. This was the first time our club was ever barred
    from a PUB. The 'Dog' - John O'Reilly went in first to a pub in Cashel,
    on our return from Cork. The publican took one look at his bearded face
    and we were all barred.</p>

    <p>I personally got great satisfaction out of our sponsored run via
    Dublin, Wicklow and KIldare - The Liffey Valley. We raised a lot of money
    from the same event. 'Crabber', 'The Pucan' and myself would mark out the
    course on a Saturday night and then retire to 'Grouser's Corner' for
    liquid refreshment.</p>

    <p>The social nights in the clubhouse were very successful, creating a
    togetherness among all. We were joined by many great characters - Jock
    Stein, Brian and Connie Corcoran, Jim McNamara and his father, Willie
    Young and others. Who can forget the 'Man in the Kilt', Fr. Andy Sheehan,
    sadly no longer with us. He was like a breath of fresh air in the club
    and enjoying the crack as we drank our gains, listening to his renderings
    from light opera.We all knew there was only one other who could compete
    with him, namely, Tom Hoagn. Our own John Blyth made a great contribution
    to these nights when he brought his father along, who was here on
    holidays from England (Scouse Land). He sang some lovely songs and told
    jokes, our enjoyment was great.</p>

    <p>These are my recollections of a great time, a great club and fantastic
    club mates.</p>
