# [Liffey Valley Athletics Club](http://lvac.grff.in)

## About

[Liffey Valley Athletic Club](http://liffeyvalleyac.com) was formed in 1974 from the amalgamation of two other clubs Avondale A.C. and Inchicore A.C.

This repository holds the code for a new version of our website. 

## How can I help?

You can go and look at [the test site](http://lvac.grff.in). Then come back and tell me what you think by opening an issue.

## I want to run it locally and hack all the codez

You will need to have PHP (5.4 at least) and [composer](http://getcomposer.org) installed. Clone this repo and then run

```sh
composer install
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then you can browse to http://localhost:8000 and see what's going on.

When you spot something broken, open a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) and send it back to me.
